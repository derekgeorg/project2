"strayTX" is a website designed around user-friendliness and information to help pet owners submit a lost pet or find their pet that may be contained in our database. Built around the Austin Animal Center and PetHarbor database, we were able to develop a website that can take in any missing pets in the Austin area. The user is given a location of where it was found as well as the pets biological information and a link to an image of said pet that is hosted on PetHarbors website. 

## Functionality

Compared to our com-pet-itors, "strayTX" focuses on usability. From the login, to searching our database, and when submitting a new pet, users will find it easy to navigate our website.

Lastly, the user has an option to submit a new pet that they have lost or if they would like to submit a pet that they have found but is no theirs, they can submit a "found" pet so that the original owner may see it appear in our database.

"strayTX" is a website designed around user-friendliness and information to help pet owners submit a lost pet or find their pet that may be contained in our database. Built around the Austin Animal Center and PetHarbor database, we were able to develop a website that can take in any missing pets in the Austin area. The user is given a location of where it was found as well as the pets biological information and a link to an image of said pet that is hosted on PetHarbors website.
